This is a repo containing a bunch of random scripts (currently all
Python) to do conversions pertaining to Opera Software's
[https://github.com/operasoftware/presto-testo](presto-testo) repo.

This is mostly a dump of stuff I've written; there's no statement as
to quality or any documentation or anything, really. They're probably
a mixture of Python 2 and Python 3.
